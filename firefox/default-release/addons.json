You can enable/disable/move options, create sub-menus/separators.\n\n- Customizable mouse/keyboard controls\n- Option to switch tabs with mouse-wheel.\n- Configurable drag and drop behavior.\n- A growing list of available actions for mouse/keyboard bindings.\n\n- Customizable styles\nSidebery provides full control of styles for sidebar and group page via variables and custom CSS.\n\n- Snapshots\nYou can setup auto snapshots that will keep info about open windows and tabs.\n\n\nPrivacy policy\n\n    Sidebery keeps all data that needed to correct work on the user's machine and doesn't send any kind of data to the outside.\n\n\n\nSource code\n\n    Source code can be found here: https://github.com/mbnuqw/sidebery\n\n\n\nPermissions\n\n    - \"Access recently closed tabs\" - needed for the \"Undo close tab\" function.\n    - \"Access browser tabs\" - needed to get info and control tabs.\n    - \"Store unlimited amount of client-side data\" - needed to store favicons cache and snapshots.\n\n\n\nOptional permissions\n\n    - \"Access your data for all websites\" and \"Control browser proxy settings\" - Required for the next features:\n        - Context menu option for cleaning cookies\n        - Proxy and url rules of containers\n        - Page-screenshots for the group page and windows selection panel\n        - Changing the User-Agent per container- \"Hide and show browser tabs\" - Required for the next features:\n        - Hiding tabs on inactive panels\n        - Hiding folded tabs- \"Read and modify bookmarks\" - needed for bookmarking the tabs and bookmarks panel functionality.\n    - \"Access browsing history\" - for history panel functionality.\n    - \"Input data to the clipboard\" - Context menu option for copying urls of tabs and bookmarks\n    - \"Download files and read and modify the browser’s download history\" - Auto-export of snapshots.\n\nNote: You can deny these permissions at any time on the settings page.\n\nNotes\n\n    - Firefox doesn't allow addons to hide the native (horizontal) tab bar.

Cookies downloaded by one Container are not available to other Containers. You can even integrate individual Containers with Mozilla VPN to protect your browsing and location. With the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, you can...\n\n    Sign in to two different accounts on the same site (for example, you could sign in to work email and home email in two different Container tabs.\n    Keep different kinds of browsing far away from each other (for example, you might use one Container tab for managing your Checking Account and a different Container tab for searching for new songs by your favorite band)\n    Avoid leaving social-network footprints all over the web (for example, you could use a Container tab for signing in to a social network, and use a different tab for visiting online news sites, keeping your social identity separate from tracking scripts on news sites)\n    Protect your browsing activity in individual Containers using Mozilla VPN, so you can shop while travelling abroad but check your bank account from a server in your home country.\n\n\nAfter installing the Firefox Multi-Account Containers extension, click the Containers icon to edit your Containers. Change their colors, names, and icons.

E.g. you always want http://example.com/foo.html to redirect to http://example.com/bar.html.\n\nThis can be useful for instance to skip confirmation pages after posting messages on message boards, skipping ad pages that appear before you can view content on certain sites, redirecting from http to https on sites where you always want the https version, redirecting from one hostname to another for proxy servers, or just anywhere where it takes you two or more clicks to get to what you want.\n\nThe extension supports both wildcards and regular expressions in patterns. Regular expressions support capturing parantheses so you could define the pattern: http://foo.com/bar.php\\?id=(\\d+) and define the redirect as http://bar.com/baz.php?id=$1. In that case http://foo.com/bar.php?id=1234 would automatically redirect to http://bar.com/baz.php?id=1234. Wildcards can also use $1, $2 in the redirect urls, $1 is the contents of the first star match, $2 of the second and so on.","weeklyDownloads":333,"type":"extension","creator":{"name":"Einar Egilsson","url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/user/61607/"},"developers":[],"screenshots":[{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/165/165524.png?modified=1622132160","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/165/165524.jpg?modified=1622132160","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"The UI for editing redirects."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/229/229457.png?modified=1622132162","width":1280,"height":800,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/229/229457.jpg?modified=1622132162","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":333,"caption":"The UI for editing redirect in dark mode."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/165/165526.png?modified=1622132162","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/165/165526.jpg?modified=1622132162","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"The Edit redirect form."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/165/165528.png?modified=1622132162","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/165/165528.jpg?modified=1622132162","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"The Delete redirect form."},{"url":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/full/165/165530.png?modified=1622132162","width":700,"height":438,"thumbnailURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/previews/thumbs/165/165530.jpg?modified=1622132162","thumbnailWidth":533,"thumbnailHeight":334,"caption":"The help, to assist you with creating redirects."}],"contributionURL":"","averageRating":4.5605,"reviewCount":156,"reviewURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/redirector/reviews/","updateDate":1585220412000},{"id":"{c607c8df-14a7-4f28-894f-29e8722976af}","icons":{"32":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/888/888648-32.png?modified=mcrushed","64":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/888/888648-64.png?modified=mcrushed","128":"https://addons.mozilla.org/user-media/addon_icons/888/888648-128.png?modified=mcrushed"},"name":"Temporary Containers","version":"1.9.2","sourceURI":"https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/downloads/file/3723251/temporary_containers-1.9.2.xpi","homepageURL":"https://github.com/stoically/temporary-containers","supportURL":"https://github.com/stoically/temporary-containers/issues","amoListingURL":"https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/temporary-containers/","description":"Open tabs, websites, and links in automatically managed disposable containers which isolate the data websites store (cookies, storage, and more) from each other, enhancing your privacy and security while you browse.","fullDescription":"Easily open disposable containers that isolate attached data and are deleted after usage: Fully automatic, based on navigation-target, for certain websites, with configured mouse clicks on links or just by using the toolbar icon.\n\n    Privacy Policy and Permissions\n    How does it enhance my privacy?\n    Matrix room: #tmp:mozilla.org\n\n\nUsage\n\n    How to open Temporary Containers?\n    Want to make the most out of Temporary Containers?
